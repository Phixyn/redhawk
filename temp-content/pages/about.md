## My projects

- - -

I am currently working on my final year group project at UOS, which is a third person puzzle game developed in Unity. More info to come soon.

I am also working on a C++ game engine built using SFML. I've submitted a first version of this engine for an University assignment and was graded a first. Currently, a lot more work is required to make it good! The repository can be [found here](#).
