## My name is Alpeche and I am a Games Programming Student at UOS.

## What I do

I am a Software Test Engineer for a small software development company based at [Adastral Park](#), Suffolk. I am studying part-time for my [BSc Computer Games Programming](#) degree at the [University of Suffolk](#). During my little spare time, I like to work on my game development projects, as well as this website. My other interests in computing include operating systems, networking and artificial intelligence.

Some of the hobbies I enjoy are gaming, playing bass guitar, going to concerts and travelling. One day, I want to move to Canada.

## My projects

I am currently working on my final year group project at UOS, which is a third person puzzle game developed in Unity. More info to come soon.

I am also working on a C++ game engine built using SFML. I've submitted a first version of this engine for an University assignment and was graded a first. Currently, a lot more work is required to make it good! The repository can be [found here](#).
