## Hello! I am Phixyn

My name is Alpeche Pancha. I work full-time as a [Software Test Engineer](#) and study part-time for my [BSc Computer Games Programming](#) degree. I am based in Suffolk, work at [Adastral Park](#) and study at the [University of Suffolk](#). Currently, I am on my final year at University.

In my little spare time, I like to work on my personal projects, such as this website. I also play video games (of course) and play the bass guitar. On this website you can find out more about my hobbies and [projects](#).

If you wish, you can drop a follow on my [Twitter](#).

## My projects

These are just some of my game projects. You can view the rest in the [projects page](#).

_TODO projects here somehow._
